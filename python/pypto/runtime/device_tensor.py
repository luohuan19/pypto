"""User-facing handle to worker-resident device memory.

A :class:`DeviceTensor` is an opaque ``(data_ptr, shape, dtype)`` triple bound
to a specific :class:`~pypto.runtime.Worker`'s address space.  Pass it to
:class:`~pypto.ir.compiled_program.CompiledProgram` in place of a
``torch.Tensor`` to skip the host→device copy on entry and the device→host
copy on exit — the runtime treats the underlying buffer as already resident
on the worker (``ContinuousTensor.child_memory == 1``).

Lifetime is **caller-managed**: every :meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.malloc`
(or :meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.alloc_tensor`) must be paired with a
matching :meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.free` (or
:meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.free_tensor`) before the Worker is closed.

Because no D2H copy happens for a ``DeviceTensor``, callers that want to
read the data back must do so explicitly via
:meth:`~pypto.runtime.Worker.copy_from`.
