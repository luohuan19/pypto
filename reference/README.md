# Reference Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains files migrated from other code repositories. These files are provided **for reference only** to demonstrate coding patterns and implementation approaches.

## Important Notes

- **Not Executable**: Files in this directory are not intended to be executed directly.
- **Reference Only**: Use these files as examples to understand implementation patterns and coding styles.
- **No Support**: These files are not maintained as part of the main codebase and may not work with the current project setup.

## Directory Structure

- `block-level/`: Block-level operation examples
- `pto-isa/`: PTO ISA examples

## Usage

When implementing new features or components, you can refer to the code patterns in this directory. However, you should adapt and integrate the approaches into the main codebase rather than using these files directly.
