# Address PR Comments Workflow

Intelligently triage PR review comments, address actionable feedback, and resolve informational comments.

## Input

Accept PR number (`123`, `#123`) or branch name (`feature-branch`).

## Workflow

1. Match input to PR
2. Fetch unresolved comments
3. Classify comments
4. Get user confirmation (Category B)
5. Address comments with code changes
6. Reply and resolve threads

## Step 1: Match Input to PR

```bash
# PR number: gh pr view <number> --json number,title,headRefName,state
# Branch: git branch --show-current && gh pr list --head <branch> --json number,title,state
```

## Step 2: Fetch Unresolved Comments

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "hw-native-sys", name: "pypto") {
    pullRequest(number: <number>) {
      reviewThreads(first: 50) {
        nodes {
          id isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes { id databaseId body path line }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Filter to `isResolved: false` only.

## Step 3: Classify Comments

| Category             | Description                          | Examples                                   |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **A: Actionable**    | Code changes required                | Bugs, missing validation, security issues  |
| **B: Discussable**   | May skip if follows `.claude/rules/` | Style preferences, premature optimizations |
| **C: Informational** | Resolve without changes              | Acknowledgments, "optional" suggestions    |

Present summary showing category, file:line, and issue for each comment. For Category B, explain why code may already comply with `.claude/rules/`.

## Step 4: Get User Confirmation

Use `AskUserQuestion` for Category B: Address (make changes) / Skip (resolve as-is) / Discuss (need clarification)

## Step 5: Address Comments

For Category A + approved Category B:

1. Read files with Read tool
2. Make changes with Edit tool
3. Commit using `/commit` skills and skip testing and review

**Commit message format:**

```text
chore(pr): resolve review comments for #<number>

- Fixed validation bug (comment #1)
- Added null check (comment #2)
```

**When to skip testing/review:**

- Minor documentation/comment fixes
- Changes already tested in original PR
- Fast iteration needed

## Step 6: Resolve Comments

Reply using `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment_id>/replies -f body="..."` then resolve thread with GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation.

**Response templates:**

- Fixed: "Fixed in `<commit>` - description"
- Skip: "Current follows `.claude/rules/<file>`"
- Acknowledged: "Acknowledged, thank you!"

## Best Practices

| Area              | Guidelines                                                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Analysis**      | Reference `.claude/rules/`; when unsure → Category B         |
| **Changes**       | Read full context; minimal edits; follow project conventions |
| **Communication** | Be respectful; explain reasoning; reference rules            |

## Error Handling

| Error             | Action                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| PR not found      | `gh pr list`; ask user to confirm  |
| Not authenticated | "Run: `gh auth login`"             |
| Unclear comment   | Mark Category B for discussion     |

## Checklist

- [ ] PR matched and validated
- [ ] Unresolved comments fetched and classified
- [ ] Category B items reviewed with user
- [ ] Code changes made and committed (use `/commit`)
- [ ] Changes pushed to remote
- [ ] All comments replied to and resolved

## Remember

**Not all comments require code changes.** Evaluate against `.claude/rules/` first. When in doubt, consult user.
